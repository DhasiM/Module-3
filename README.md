# A User-reviews and Sentiment Based Restaurant Selection System

Where Should I Eat?

In 2018, Yelp had reviews from between 1307 (Forth Worth) to 18, 754 (NYC) restaraunts in 26 major cities! Yelp and other review sites are supposed to make it easier for customers to make informed choices based on other users' reviews. But you have to read the reviews, imagine reading even 5 reviews. No thanks! Maybe you'll just click on the ones with the highest rating. But what if you still have 50 restaurants with 5 star reviews? Okay, maybe you do decide to read the reviews after all. But wait, some of those reviews don't say much, some are rants and others are just downright confusing. Wouldn't it be easier if a computer can do all that reading and analysing for you?

We propose a system that performs sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews and helps narrow down a users choices for them. This system would:
* 1. Analyse the user's input to obtain the cuisine type and find the restaurants that offer that cuisine, food or similar options
* 2. Analyse the sentiment of the reviews of the highest rated restaurants in that category and choose the ones with the best sentiment
