# A User-reviews and Sentiment Based Restaurant Selection System

Where Should I Eat?

In 2018, Yelp had reviews from between 1307 (Forth Worth) to 18, 754 (NYC) restaraunts in 26 major cities! Yelp and other review sites are supposed to make it easier for customers to pick based on other user's reviews but how imagine reading even 5 reviews. So maybe you decide to choose the restaurant with the highest review ratings but you still have 50 restaurants with 5 star reviews. What's more some of those reviews aren't even talkign about the food, and still other are just downright confusing. Would'nt it be easier if a computer can do all that reading and anlysing for you?

We propose a system that performs sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews and helps narrow down a users choices for them. This system would:
* 1. Analyse the user's input to obtain the cuisine type and find the restaurants that offer that cuisine, food or similar options
* 2. Analyse the sentiment of the reviews of the highest rated restaurants in that category and choose the ones with the best sentiment
