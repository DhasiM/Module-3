So, Sweet Pea and I, along with B and one of his girls, and KDawg went here last night to celebrate AZ Restaurant Week, a couple of bdays, and well because we can.  I was very ready to like it because its downtown and supposed to be localorganicwhatever.  Unfortunately I didnt like it.  No, I didnt.This place is completely generic, people!  Generic environment, generic food, bad service...that sums it up.  You know what?  It even bores my ss to discuss the food at all, so let me just give you the lowlightsThey said the bloody marys were their own mix and spicy.  If thats their own mix, they should check out Mr. Ts because its better...and spicier.  When asked for more spice, they gave Sweet Pea a little room service bottle of tabasco.  They forgot Bs drink, and when reminded, tried to play it off.  They did nothing for birthdays.  They were supposed to give us two glasses of wine as our wine pairing and the timing was totally wrong...we had to remind them that a red should have come with our entree.  Although we were one of three tables in the restaurant, the food runner wandered around the dining room with our food while we watched, trying to figure out whose it was.Oh, the goat cheese fondue was just kinda ok.Hotel restaurants can be good.  T. Cooks, Lons, etc. etc.  This is not one of those.  The only reason I can see to eat here is that youre staying at the Westin and dont want to leave the property for some reason.',1,1,0,3.811059907834101,1.4700460829493087,0.6543778801843319,0.9907834101382488,0.0936249999999999,0.5316666666666667,8,5,0.3859962959438887,6,'topping ingredient, vegetarian, southern ,us','Restaurants, Lounges, Burgers, Nightlife, Breakfast & Brunch, American (New), Bars',0,'Phoenix',33.4517282,-112.073067,'Province Urban Kitchen & Bar'),(2,'0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog','e0sSaUTTxu0QzQZFe8wXA','BHt7biSHtXPmxszYb1UiQQ',5,'2016-06-30','Nobuos has a beautiful, creative little cocktail menu that I adore. Ive eaten here for lunch and dinner, and I absolutely recommend the dinner menu. The Teeter houses dining areas are sectioned off into different rooms, so the atmosphere is intimate and kind of romantic I came to dinner with a party of six and we each ordered three tapas which are all portioned off to share and split them among the group over a span of three hours. The dining experience is a constant stream of small portions, but its relaxing and exciting all at once. I strongly recommend this as a date spot or just a place to take your family out of their comfort zone. My family lived in Japan for five years, and it was so rewarding to bring back some of those tastes and memories for my parents when they visited Phoenix.',0,0,0,4.253554502369668,1.471563981042654,0.5734597156398105,0.8341232227488151,0.2247023809523809,0.6619047619047619,10,1,0.805343436716792,12,'beverage, vegetarian, japanese','Restaurants, Caterers, Japanese, Tea Rooms, Food, Event Planning & Services',0,'Phoenix',33.4495554434,-112.06568217,'Nobuo At Teeter House'),(3,'0F0drnShYJr6HhyQjA3Tpg','Jwpfh3DJyswMa7EU0YOrPg','sccPVgHWRAww1atzaOfOYQ',3,'2011-10-16','A good cozy spot for coffee with really nice people at the helm.

First was lunch while shopping the local shops, I ordered iced tea and a sandwich, and was deeply disappointed. The sandwich was not good, however it had things on it that I wasnt sure I would like to begin with so I cant really hold that against them. My iced tea on the other hand was old. It had that old tea taste. Making tea at home, the tea usually gets that taste after 3 or 4 days. When I told the server and asked for something else she didnt know what I was talking. Like she didnt understand that iced tea does go bad. She brought me another tea that was fine eventually.     The second visit was a private party and everything was great. Drinks good, food great, staff friendly and help full. The only thing possible off putting was the menu listed a roast beef sandwich that had beets on it without mentioning the beets.

I believe this place really has some potential if some parts improve. We went there in a large group, around 8 people. The menu pretty much says it all, and I ordered the Dirty Club after reviewing many yelp reviews. Each of us waited for 1015 minutes. We initially did not have a place to eat, but once we all got our food the table in the middle was empty and we crowded there. I dont mind eating while I stand, but the place needs more seats for sure. I was suspicious of the waffle sandwich thats worth 15, but once I got it I knew it was totally worth it. It was HUGE. I absolutely loved the fried chicken and the beef bacon inside. Bother were juicy and freshly done. It was the biggest boneless thigh  leg Ive ever seen in my life, and the skin was so CRISPY. The first bite was full of oily meat and it felt fantastic. But as I went on, I felt bored. There was only the taste of meat, oil and nothing else. I tried putting on lots of syrup, but the flavor seemed to disappear each time I bite it. I feel that it needs some kind of sauce or marination to get the omg feel. I also think that the Dirty Club is in a larger portion than the ODB in comparing the price. The portions of the sides were also tiny, dont really recommend them if they are not included in the meal you want.  Next up the waffle. The waffles I had were supper crispy, which was the way I like them. However, I noticed that the waffles did not have enough batter inside. So they were pretty much empty in the middle. They also hurt my hard palate the flesh above the tongue, since they were dry and crunchy...I tried the waffle of an ODBs and they were softer, honestly hoped I had the thin but fluffy than the thick but empty, even though I like crispy waffles. I dont know if it was only me or does every Dirty Club gets waffles with less batter than the ODB?',0,1,0,3.6375,0.9666666666666668,0.4041666666666667,0.5541666666666667,0.0695611577964519,0.5784469343292874,16,11,0.5095640623015177,8,'appetizer, non vegetarian, southern ,us','Gluten-Free, Chicken Shop, Burgers, Fast Food, Comfort Food, Breakfast & Brunch, Restaurants, American (Traditional), Soul Food, Chicken Wings, Canadian (New), Waffles',0,'Toronto',43.6546466,-79.4005612,'The Dirty Bird Chicken + Waffles'),(24,'5VXxZIMgoKRWbNa6x9kMfw','lqiOol3S1Vhtal3aeDsFQ','N5g4Kq7DUtnPgooyJJ41w',4,'2015-08-03','This place is sweet!

I can say this is definitely the best brunch buffet spot right now in Las Vegas this overtakes the now defunct jasmine brunch in the Bellagio... Im still mourning at its lost. This brunch is in its own class! top quality food items that tops other brunches lobster tail! unlimited champagne good ambience and service pricey so not for everyoneLocation is inside the Ballys resort and hotel. Parking is shared with Paris hotel and it connects both. The sterling brunch is located in the BLT steakhouse. This place had a recent renovation and he restaurant definitely is classy looking, much more then the casino itself. FoodThis is the highlight. This place has all high end food items and no other buffet compares in terms of quality, as it should for a price point of 90 per person 85 per person if you sign up for a free total rewards card. Drinks are included in his brunch, including brut champagne! Does not include bloody Marys. My favorite food items include the sea bass, filet mug in, Alaskan king crab, jumbo shrimp cocktail, the rack of lamb with chimichurri sauce and lobster tail. Yes gigantic pacific lobster tail is part of this buffet! Other items include made to order omelettes with lobster, caviar, sushi, cold items, charcuterie, prime rib and so much more. The overall selection is less the places like Bacchanal and wicked spoon, however his can be a good thing because they have a lot of blister dishes, while this brunch can concentrate making its more limited menu fantastic.You also get a fresh batch of their freshly baked popovers which are some of the best popovers Ive had beats Jordan pond in Maine, however be careful because they can fill you up. They tasted great dipped with the lobster bisque. Dessert great selection of mini pastries such as chocolate mousse, chocolate covered strawberries, macaroons, cake pops, and tarts. Their brioche bread pudding French toast with bananas foster is perhaps he best French toast Ive ever had that I qualify it as a dessert. There are multiple layers to the bread that are crispy on the edges and the insides soak up the sweet syrup. Perfection!ServiceOur waiter was excellent.

We are so happy we did! If you come here, get something worth trying that you wont find on other menus dont get your standard tacos, fajitas, or enchiladas. Our server was very helpful and offered excellent suggestions.We started with the Pepitas Guacamole  not your typical guac. They add veggies, pepitas, and other ingredients to make it extra delicious and different. The salsa that comes with it was amazing too!For entrees we shared a steak dish, Tampiquena, as well as the Carnitas. Although Carnitas is something you can find in many places, this one was fantastic. Our server highly recc as his favorite dish  Our favorite was the Tampiquena steak. The Tampiquena comes with a cheese enchilada covered in mole sauce. Im not a fan of Mole sauce, but my fianc absolutely loved it. The sauce was only on the cheese enchilada so it didnt alter the deliciousness of the steak for me. I also loved the Habanero Slaw that came with the Carnitas.

I was updated when my order was taking a long time to fill. I was given a free sample of an agua frescas with cucumber and spinach. I was offered a refill on my soda. All points to the positive. More points to the positive is the quality of the food. They make everything fresh. My tacos were alright. The meat was hot and perfectly cooked. The refried beans were on point. The rice was about the best Ive had. It was full of flavor and fluffy. Even the various salsas were quite good. The one I had, roasted I think, was not too hot but gave a nice flavor boost to my tacos. Salsa was not 100 necessary but a welcome edition for sure.So why am I giving only a 3 star review when everything is so good? Well, there is more to the story. I was picking up lunch for my office. I ordered a total of 6 combo number 1s. That combo comes with 4 tacos, rice, beans and a drink. Yeah, I had my hands full with this one. Anyhow, we all wanted a variety of tacos. Carne asada, pollo, al pastor, carnitas. We wanted it all. Nobody ended up getting al pastor. Taco Rico didnt have any made. So I made the decision to switch to the carnitas. I got all of the first 5 orders placed and was ready to place my own. I was going to try asada, pollo, carnitas and barbacoa. I ended up with two each asada and barbacoa because I was told they would not give me all different meats. They claimed it was too much work to make so many different tacos with different meats. That was disappointing. So was the fact that their credit card terminal was not working so I had to bum some cash off a coworker. This was supposed to be her birthday lunch. She was not supposed to pay. To further my disappointment, it took nearly 50 minutes to get my full order. 50 minutes! Apparently 1100 AM is too early for lunch because I had to wait for much of it to be cooked. That includes the rice. Meanwhile my coworkers were back at the office getting more and more hungry. All but the one coworker that is.My assistant in this lunch venture, whom I am happy went with me, was a great help in translating everything. The cashier spoke English but I think it was easier for her to speak Spanish. It bothered me a little bit when she started ignoring me and speaking directly to my companion. Whatever. I got the message. It may have been second hand but I felt well informed. In the end, the service was friendly, the food was fresh but average, the tacos are small, and the beans and rice I could have used more of. The delays and frustrations of limitations are just too much for me to overlook. That is why this is a 3 star review today.',5,2,4,4.4,1.35,0.55,1,0.2528555718475073,0.549297816878462,26,8,0.54397536753357,8,'topping ingredient, vegetarian, mexican','Mexican, Restaurants',0,'Las Vegas',36.1523481,-115.1544873,'Taco Rico Los 3 Gallos'),(41,'7wMB3wMbOp0gq3l6nHfOaA','tDa0VhbZ3ZLjV2w94yTyg','qn1kjsaSztkNZusy3rg',1,'2015-09-18','The food was great, which makes what happened even more disappointing. After everyone in my party had paid a group of 7, some paying together and some with bank cards we exited the restaurant. We were about 5 steps from the door when our waiter ran out after us yelling Not all of you left tips! Excuse me? First of all, even if we hadnt, chasing after us and screaming making a scene isnt the way to convince us to actually leave you a tip. Secondly, every single person is not going to leave you a cash tip when some are paying together, and some are paying with cards. Common Sense. Lastly, the restaurant actually kept one of our party members change, which was over 5. They didnt want to demand it as they are nonconfrontational. So theres your tip from that customer right there, which technically you stole to begin with. Very saddening.

As such, its predictably packed with students between the months of September to April and it definitely affects wait times.This past summer, this location was renovated in an attempt to speed up service I think. Unfortunately, every time Ive been in here, the lines all move fairly slowly and the food service folks making bagels and sandwiches just cant keep up even though the five cashiers are plugging away at the lines. More often than not, something in my order is wrong when I go to this location. Its usually my drink, now Ive learned to check it before I leave, and its also been my food. I went there two days ago and asked for a bacon breakfast sandwich on an english muffin. The guy called out my order number, handed me my order and I went to work assuming it was correct because you identified it by my order number... at least i thought you knew what you were doing. Couldnt be more wrong. Bacon breakfast sandwich on an english muffin? Sausage and egg white breakfast sandwich on a jalepeno biscuit. Not only was this so completely wrong I couldnt believe it but it made me sick after eating it I had a choice, eat it or not have breakfast at all. They seem to do okay at lunch but the breakfast rush here just kills the staff. I dont know what happened to the old staff that used to work here, they were really on top of things, but the new staff seems to have issues with reading and producing orders, speaking english well and listening.

Now, for the Staff..Been to this location at least 6 times each and every time, I get friendly service with a smile  until the pushy sales pitch. I understand the concept of upselling and working on commission, trust me. However, having friendly service and a smile up UNTIL I opt not to have a monthly wash.. Not okay. Every time, without fail, the attendant pitches me their monthly program and then when I say no, literally SHUTS DOWN. I say I might look into it next time, to which he walks away to his computer without a word, prints the ticket, and sticks out his hand for me to grab it, no eye contact. I say thanks, with no response, and then go to pay. Seriously? If someone doesnt want to pay monthly for car washes, ACCEPT IT AND TELL THEM TO HAVE A NICE DAY  its basic customer service.

Typically packed with greens and not so much on the sugar. Carolina Smoothies, where they have the appeal for the masses and maybe not SO much on the health side, what they do is great. The availability of smoothies without sugar, fresh juices, replacements for any sort of dairy, and other healthy additives is a huge plus for this joint. If youre in the mood for a simple fruit smoothie and not a bunch of other junk added in, they will accommodate. My recent favorite is the Key Lime Cooler sans yogurt, extra banana, no agave or sugar added. Tart and refreshing. Great for a morning meal or postworkout. The prices vary and the sizes are absurd. Youre not going to find a ridiculous 465oz smoothie here, which I like. Also, they have tons of snack foods to choose from  pretzels, nuts, bars, mixes, etc. I really like the community board in the back, too. Lots of local info on races, activities, etc. Im a fan!

Ive had the Korean pancake, sundubu, kimchi jjigae and their dumpling soup mandu duk guk?.  By far my favorite dish is the dumpling soup!  Everything else is decent, but Ive had better versions of each dish elsewhere.  The dumplings in this soup are large and filled with meat and veggies, there are lots of rice cakes in the soup, and the broth is very tasty it seems that other versions Ive had dont have as flavorful of a broth as here.Im glad that this spot opened up, since its a great change from all the other chains along Craig Road.  With banchan, you get a good sized lunch for under 10.  If youre planning on going around 12pm1pm though, be sure to block out at least a full hour.

With more restaurants per square mile than any other place in the world or some insane statistic like that, the research was daunting. However, I stumbled upon LOrignal and the reviews were good, and the website was informative, and the pictures looked great. So, I booked and was looking forward to the dinnerIntro. A walk downstairs brought us to the restaurant. Its decorated in woodsy tones and animal heads on the wall to go with the Moose theme. The place was packed for Saturday 7pm, and the hostess brought us to the worst table ever. We were wedged between a table of 14 and another table for two forming a Lshape. This meant that everyone who got up and down from the table of 14 bumped into my boyfriend and when the table beside us for two they sat by a wall  wanted to get out, we had to stand up. However, there were no other tables available...My bf and I started with a dozen oysters which were all right. I also had the Tuna Tartare which was the heaviest dish I have ever had. Large chunks of tuna smothered in some heavy mayonnaiselike sauce and the portion was the size of my head. Then, for my main, I had Elk which was so very big and heavy. For dessert, my bf loved their Tiramisu so much that we ordered two, so again, another heavy course.I will have to say that my review is slightly biased in that I was very sick afterwards I suspect it was because I just had a huge Sausage lunch just hours before and I am not used to eating heavy dishes. Would I have loved the food if I was famished and on a different night? Perhaps. Ill give the restaurant that. However, I just thought the food was too much and too heavy.Service was just AMAZING! Our waitress was professional and kind and knowledgeable and very accommodating. The table for two beside us soon left and I asked if we could have their table away from the table of 14 cougars. She said absolutely and even combined our table to make it for 4. I have to say, this was one of the best service I have received in Canadian restaurants which is why I am bumping this rating to a 3.5.With so many other restaurants in Montreal, I highly doubt I will be back here again.',2,1,2,4.208955223880597,0.8308457711442786,0.2686567164179104,0.4427860696517413,0.1172533247533247,0.5053560703560702,11,11,0.5080777182257445,8,'beverage, vegetarian, french','Canadian (New), Restaurants, French',0,'Montréal',45.5027327,-73.55798,'L\'Orignal'),(89,'DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg','4sRHO7ccJBCHSWvodCOQ','Ljll53fjjOhnyte2XZMxwg',5,'2015-10-16','Never disappointed Amazing foodThis time ordered unconventional order but was great.My seven year old who had parafait and orange juice at the zoo 15 min before coming ended up eating half Parantha and paneer.Fresh vada absolutely great',1,1,0,3.937269372693727,1.4280442804428044,0.4649446494464944,0.5977859778597786,0.4011904761904762,0.5738095238095238,4,1,0.8198856516290727,13,'topping ingredient, vegetarian, italian','Restaurants, Vegetarian, Pakistani, Vegan, Indian',0,'Tempe',33.4480887488,-111.9268833664,'Udupi'),(90,'DT35ycaAVzbq83vVGRCoIQ','cLxXXXIU30YJ7xAaghMLng','U92wXzli7sbdhMFEJyVVlw',1,'2017-11-27','I went to order a make your own salad and they mixed the salad with the dressing, I then asked them to add some spinach and they said they had to take out some of the lettuce if I wanted spinach.

I had heard that the food was very good and so we decided to go there. Well I was hugely disappointed. The food was mediocre I started with the Carpaccio which was very bland and the presentation, well lets say there wasnt one. The carpaccio lacked flavour and it was served with small shavings of parmesan cheese. Ive had carpaccio at other restaurants in the city and it has always been delicious, flavourful and served with wonderful dressed greens. My entree was the Seafood alla Newburg, again bland. My scallops were cooked perfectly, the shrimp was over done, but my lobster tail was a tad too chewy. The sauce was bland, I added some chili flakes and some parmesan cheese and that helped. The service was lacking and a bit messy at one point as they got our meals mixed up. I also think the bartender hasnt a clue as to how to mix cocktails. My friend had to send her cocktail back three times to get it right and yet it wasnt completely right! One of the servers actually tasted the cocktail from the same glass before getting a new one! Guess she didnt believe my friend when she told her it wasnt good. The ambiance is lovely, but I was here for the food and unfortunately it was a complete let down.I will not go back and nor any of my friends. I will also not recommend it.. One of my friends in the group who had been here twice before thinks the ownership has changed hands.

Hey, my interest was piqued once I saw the sign that read, Food served all day! I cant resist, yknow? It turns out that Kimmies is merely one of those quiet little suburban bars that is frequented mainly by people who all seem to know each other. You feel strange when you first walk in but feel more comfortable as time wears on. Based on what we had for dinner, Id say the food isnt what draws people here. Kays coconut shrimp and potato pancakes were a little overdone. My crabcakes looked and tasted prefabricated and were only marginally filled with crabmeat. Although Ive had better, the coleslaw was sweet, crunchy, and was served in a bighearted heap of a portion. The pierogi we had as an appetizer were crispy on the outside and were full of fluffy potatoes. Not bad, but again, there are superior rogi to be found. The rest of the menu is small and includes pizza, steak, and a bunch of different sandwiches. I almost ordered Kimmies Sub. Meh. Then I almost ordered the corned beef. Meh. Most of the patrons were really into The Shawshank Redemption, which aired on the telly and was nearing its conclusion. I really dug the glasses our beverages were served in. Mine was Beatlesthemed! Kays was inspired by The Hangover and had a line from the movie on it.The bartender, whom I assumed was Kimmie herself, seems like a really congenial, convivial person brimming with chutzpah. She jokingly interrogated me on my activities during the day.You didnt work today?No, I was off. The place I work for is closed Thanksgiving and the day after.Oh, baloney!

I had the Spicy Basil with Chicken lunch special, spicy level 3 out of 5 and thought it was spiced perfectly for my taste.  Usually some restaurants will either under spice or over spice when asking for a middle of the range level, but this was perfectly spicy will not making me reach for water after every bite.

The restaurant wasnt busy seeing there was one patron sitting at the bar and only maybe 4 or five tables occupied. Our server took our drink order and we ordered an appetizer.  Our server brought us our drinks and we asked for some more time to decide what we wanted to order. 1520 minutes later our server came back and asked if we were doing alright. She then remembered that we hadnt ordered yet. She apologized and said that she had put are appetizer order in already. Where I was seated I had a good vantage point of the entire kitchen. I could see tickets were stacking up and food was not coming out. A tall white guy seemed to be running the show in the kitchen and the wait staff were upset that food was taking so long. Two of the five cooks were standing next to each other and talking and joking around. When the wait staff inquired about their food the tall white guy scoffed at them and made rude remarks. After about an hour our food finally made it out, well kind of. They gave my buddy and I curly fries when he ordered tater tots and I ordered big dipper fries. We all received our food except my son who ordered the kids burger. We told the waitress the problem and she took our plates back to the pass and talked to the tall white guy and he sent her back to our table with the plates. She said that we could have the curly fries and they would bring out additional tater tots and big dipper fries. 15 minutes or so later she brought a huge side of tater tots and a huge side of big dipper fries and my sons burger. The tater tots were super dark and way over cooked and when my son opened his burger the inside of the bun was black charcoal burnt. I showed our server and she took the burger back, 15 minutes later he got a new burger with a bun that was edible. Our server came back later and apologized for all the problems and thats when I explained to her that I knew it wasnt her fault and that I could see the issues in the kitchen.  I told her that if it had been my restaurant I would fire the entire kitchen staff.  She explained that it had been a busy week, I told her that the person in charge of the kitchen seemed super unorganized and unfriendly. She asked if I was talking about the tall white guy and I said yes, she told me that he is the GM.

That was before any renovations took place. With the new management and recent renovations, Wow! I had no idea how much nicer it was both inside and out! The casino looks great and the new dealertainers add a nice touch as well. While the rooms are still just as old as the building itself, I think that adds to the charm of the place.

While waiting I couldnt help but notice that there were fruit flies in the glass, dishwasher, and both beer tap areas of the bar. After some time, the food arrived. The burger was gray and very dry. This disgusting thing between two pieces of bread was far past well done. I politely refused to eat it and given the sanitation issues of this location declined to have the burger remade. The burger was taken off the bill. I took a picture of this nasty thing and the receipts as proof of the legitimacy of this review.

Nothing great but definitely not bad. Very basic menu with a lot of variety, which I like when I dont know what I want or when with a group. I dined here twice on my trip in Vegas. The first was right around midnight, my BF and I ordered togo meals to take to the room. The girl was nice and after taking our order, offered for us to sit in a corner booth to wait for our food since it would take 10 minutes or so. We took our seat and waited. and waited. and waited. a good 2530 minutes later, we realized we hadnt gotten our food, and not one person came up to us to let us know our food was ready or not. So I got up to ask the girl what was going on, she had our food sitting on the back counter. She asked my name and gave me the bag. Once in the room, the food was pretty lukewarm. Not a huge deal, but I just wish she would have kept a better read of the situation. We were maybe 5 steps from where she was, right around the corner. Aw well. Food was fine.The second time was the morning we were leaving, grabbing breakfast before hitting the road. The server was nice, took our order since we were ready quickly. Food and drinks came out semi quick and were all delivered by different people. When our food was dropped off, I asked for more ketchup since ours was empty. He said, okay in a somewhat confused voice and never returned. A server never really came back until we flagged someone down that we were ready for the check, after sitting there with empty plates for a few minutes. Now, I have worked as a server in the past, so I get it when youre busy, but there is still a way to keep up with your tables or have someone else do it. The real problem is that the restaurant was not super busy. maybe 34 full and I saw at least 1012 employees buzzing around so didnt seem under staffed. Eat here if you dont care about customer service or if youre not in a rush. The food is decent and they have a lot to chose from.

I was so disgusted We got the bill and the waiter told us all he could do was discount us 10.  to 6. As the chops were 14.95 and still on the bill I asked to speak to the owner.

One of the items that was a casualty of this were the risotto offerings.  Dried out on top and quite salty.  Other dishes suffered as well, but the one main problem our table found was that many of the dishes were too salty, and the dishes that offered a sweet and savory flavor ended up been too much on a sweet side.  The risottos, polentas, and some of the meats at the carvery were a bit salty.The experience was fine, not spectacular, for the 27 price tag. I will come back to check out their dinner buffet.

When we finally got up to the checkin desk, we were told that our table would be located on the bottom level.  We requested a table on the main level, because I didnt think my mom could make it back down that ramp.  They were very kind and changed our table.  The food was ok  think of Rawhide without the town  food is basically the same.  You go for the food and atmosphere  not just the food.  Steaks were cooked correctly, drinks were refilled and service was attentive and pleasant.  If it werent for the hastle of trying to get my poor mom up and down the ramps, we would probably come again, but sorry, just not worth it  once was enough.',0,0,0,2.98974358974359,1.1128205128205129,0.4346153846153846,0.4935897435897436,0.0794708994708994,0.5281084656084656,4,5,0.3751105026645762,6,'appetizer, vegetarian, italian','Steakhouses, Hotels, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Restaurants',0,'Phoenix',33.3703478235,-111.9735761889,'Rustler\'s Rooste'),(136,'KyUFj09bfowyddCuOTP4mg','rJhBtTlz4DTfMuAKL58O9g','9mkaaU4tx5J029axdvGXg',4,'2016-04-04','This place has pretty good pho in Glendale glitters!

I couldnt understand why Chinese food sucks so bad in Vegas compared to the other major cities.  I finally learned it is because all the head chefs go to the major cities and all the sous chefs go to secondary towns like Vegas to try to fool the locals.Tonight I ordered 4 thingsFried Tofu, Eggplant, Brisket Curry, and Peking Porkchops. The fried tofu was the only thing done right, but of course, theyre frozen and just refried. To mess up this dish would be like ruining french fries.  Possible but unlikely.  Theyre cut into large squares which strange, traditionally in Asia theyre only a quarter of the size.  The point is to eat more fried surface, not less.The eggplant, the sauce was.......... super American it was a sweet sauce which is strange and looked like it was a spinoff of barbecue sauce.The brisket curry had no brisket, it was 100 tendon.  Plus I dont care where you go or what anyone says,  you dont add green peppers into curry dishes.  Just like when you find carrots in your beef and broccoli or peas in your fried rice.  They didnt do this because someone in the kitchen has a culinary passion.  No, not for 7.98, they did this to fill the dish and make it look bigger.   Id rather have a smaller bowl of curry but it is done right like in authentic Indian joints.The Peking Porkchops.   Do you like ketchup? its just fried pork smothered in ketchup except it was even more acidic.  You can smell the added vinegar from a mile away.  It was awful.We barely ate any of it and when we got the check, no one cared why we barely touched the food.  They then handed me the bill on an American Express tray and handed me back my card saying they dont take American Express.  I pointed to the logo and laughed.   I looked around and realized what I had done wrong.  EVERYONE ELSE ordered a bowl of noodles.  Like some type of wonton noodle variation with duck or something.In summary, if you come here just get the wonton noodle bowl and stfu,  dont order anything else.  its a nightmare and its too tall of an order for their service ability.',0,0,0,3.16017316017316,1.103896103896104,0.5930735930735931,0.6493506493506493,0.0019841269841269,0.4256410256410255,13,18,0.2368632608820902,3,'topping ingredient, vegetarian, chinese','Restaurants, Chinese, Noodles, Barbeque',0,'Las Vegas',36.1258775,-115.197855,'Cafe Noodle & Chinese Barbeque'),(140,'LFZS0THXFuiBCaeuxTkuKQ','QZfdElMLgj0Dc5DNaRCpw','E8QO4UpKFR2tfPMhyCiVYg',4,'2017-06-18','Great flavorful food, soso service.

Ive tried the lunch thali and several dishes in a group setting for dinner. Off the bat I would definitely recommend dinner as I found lunch to be a bit overpriced and nowhere near as flavourful as the dinner dishes. Our large group arrived for dinner on a Saturday night and the place seemed to have a decent buzz. There is no doubt that the dcor here is chic, upscale, and modern perfectly straddling the line between East and West. Our group of 6 decided to order one dish each so we could taste a few things. My favourite dishes were the Malai Kofta and the Baingan Bharta. The Malai Kofta was perfectly creamy, with a rich sauce and great nutty flavours from the dumplings. The baingan was out of this world good, great smokiness from the eggplant with a nice kick from the spices. Chicken tikka masala and lamb vindaloo where good but not great, the lamb while quite spicy was a bit greasy. The Punjabi daal makhni spiced lentil dish was not good, pretty bland and definitely my least favourite dish on the night. It is important to note that each dish is available in 4 spice levels so one can adjust to their tolerance. The price was slightly higher than what Im used to at similar establishments but the larger portions and astounding ambiance justify this. The service was, in a word, clumsy. What our server lacked in finesse he certainly made up for in persistence, constantly asking if we wanted alcohol and being seemingly disappointed that the answer was a unanimous no. However he soon moved from alcohol to dessert only to be dismayed that we were simply here for dinner. Although I appreciate that he has to try and push alcohol and dessert as thats where the real profit margin is, some training about how to do this properly needs to be implemented. Despite the few bumps along the way and the proclamation that our waiter hates eggplant, after we ordered an eggplant dish the service was efficient and attentive. They also have an extensive cocktail menu and in house mixologist which is a nice touch. Overall will I be back, probably in the distant future but this place certainly has promise as long as they can iron out the kinks.

And todate, I still have not tried their ramen but I finally made it up to the Milk Bar. First of all, the Milk Bar is located in the 2nd floor from the restaurant. The first time we tried to find it, we couldnt see it on the first floor as it was just the restaurant and there were no signs that points it was on the 2nd floor. This time, we asked and they pointed us upstairs. It is a small refrigerated glass room with the different selection of cookies and pies. No wonder we couldnt find it the first time.The cookies are 2 each, delivered from Williamsburg in NY. I picked two different kind  the fan favourite Compost cookie and the Corn cookie. As the name suggest, the Compost cookie is made from a mix of everything  chocolate cookies, chips, pretzels, oaks, ground coffee. So basically, a compost of ingredients. Taste  well, it taste like a chocolate oatmeal cookie to me, not that impressed... why is it a fan favourite? I have no idea ... I personally dont like it at all.The Corn cookie on the other hand, was much better. It could be because I like corn bread so the corn cookie taste similar. There was corn taste and it was very soft, you can taste a lot of butter in it. But definitely a lot better than the Compost cookie. At least the corn cookie might get me to return for more if I have a craving for it.',0,0,0,3.134453781512605,1.6974789915966386,0.7563025210084033,0.9747899159663864,0.1843181818181818,0.4665151515151515,8,0,0.5336857057416269,8,'dessert, vegetarian, southern ,us','Bakeries, Custom Cakes, Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt, Food, Desserts',0,'Toronto',43.64947,-79.38633,'Milk Bar Toronto'),(156,'NtiBsNppXU0XS4zM89dphQ','GOUai36MqaROrr0wsYeenQ','cJtiT0RGUYxq5TxWQw',5,'2014-04-16','This is my home mall.

In doing a healthy lunch search on here, I came across this place which I had bookmarked some time ago.I called ahead of time after looking for a menu online. The lady who answered was very bubbly and willing to let me know, everyday is special here. By that she meant there arent specials persay but a daily wrap item with a number of side choices available. She read me the whole list of things they had and I couldnt help but to check it out.It has been awhile since I have visited Mill Ave. I was aware there have been many changes to what is available there but I must have missed the No Free Parking for anyone, no matter what. I am beginning to realize it is unfair to drop stars for the business due to a decision made by the city. Okay, so I pay my 2 for what I know will take less than 20 minutes. Parking lot off of 3rd st  Ash.The location is hidden a bit in the court area, it does provide signage if youre paying attention and quite honestly, had I had the time I would have sat on their quaint little patio to enjoy my food. The gent was very friendly, explained the whole run down and chatted as he prepped my wrap for me. Double dill chickpea wrap with a side of tomato lentil curry. It was difficult to decide on my side... the Southwest Tapatio Pintos sounded really good as did the Pineapple Jalapeno Rice Pilaf. However, if youve read any other reviews, I LOVE curry! With that said, there is not enough curry in the world to satisfy my curry needs. And so, tomato curry lentils... add some broccoli, shredded carrot, green onion, lentils, tomato and not enough curry for me. The curry is there dont get me wrong, but I would douse it all over, in and on top. The double dill chickpea wrap, I wasnt sure what that even meant. Whole chickpeas, likely for some substance and a rice hummus like filling? Zucchini, maybe a dash of cayenne, identifiable dill thank goodness and crispy crunchy romaine. Gone, in seconds! I feel like I had a pretty healthy bite to eat today. Oddly enough, its the one time I may say there wasnt enough salt. That isnt to say the flavor was lacking because it wasnt by any means. It just means they likely use an appropriate amount of salt and let the flavors do the talking. Easier to put it in than it is to take it out, I always say so the salt part is really neither here nor there. Some of the sides are the same as yesterday, which he said everything is made fresh, probably not necessarily daily, depending on their business from the previous day. I am totally good with a next day side although I did notice on their instagram posted menu from yesterdat. I like the thought that this minimizes waste. Rather than tossing tons of food daily, you get a few options that assist the undecisive customer and in the meantime prevent tons of wasted food. So, kudos to them!My guess is that since the menu is ever changing and if you dont have Facebook or Instagram, its best to call ahead to find out what they have for the day.',20,11,17,4.729357798165138,1.5596330275229358,0.4724770642201835,0.9541284403669724,0.1293377120963328,0.4317391899288451,24,7,0.776794744376414,12,'topping ingredient, vegetarian, italian','Vegetarian, Gluten-Free, Restaurants, Vegan',0,'Tempe',33.4259738171,-111.940346,'Desert Roots Kitchen'),(164,'OoKNxTMu5YAaNgQKQ4SrzA','6igaS0qa4TTtZxnqetR6NQ','o7F0OgIBXZME0vPWzFobow',5,'2015-02-26','Great Vegan place with all fresh items with staff that is super friendly and make the meal that much better.

We noticed a few kitchen staff walk by, but we waited a good five minutes before someone greeted us at the cash to take our orders. Understaffed, perhaps?Then we proceeded to look for a table. There were a lot of empty tables, but quite a few of them were dirty and left uncleaned, and the whole dining area looked like it hadnt been vacuumed in a week. Again, we thought maybe they were really understaffed on that particular day...I decided to try the Lentil Quinoa Bowl with Chicken. Chicken, quinoa, brown rice, lentils, tomato, kale, and spinach, all mixed in a miso soup. It sounded healthy and it looked healthy, but...it did not taste healthy at all. Not until I poured an entire cup of hot water into the extremely salty broth! The saltiness was so overpowering that I did not realize there was a bit of a spicy kick to the soup, which was nice. Considering it cost me about 10, the portion was also smaller than expected its just mostly soup.

I ordered the cheaper 100 omakase again which I do believe is a good deal given the amount of food you get but the quality of fish has gone downhill since my last visit.The signature hamachi with jalapeno?  Devoid of all velvety tenderness.  The salmon sashimi?  Like chewing a rug.  The maguro nigiri?  Stringy and tough.On top of it all, I ventured out and tried the hamachi kama.  Not bad, but terrible for 20.  In San Diego, you can get the same size hamachi kama with every bite just as, if not more, succulent for 9.  There is no excuse, honestly.  If you are going to charge me 20, you better make sure not a single sliver of white meat is dry.  Half the fish was, but luckily there was dipping sauce to keep the meat from being unbearable to the palate.Nobu isnt a complete loss, though.  Like I stated before, the omakase is a great deal, price wise.  It comes with the famed bento dessert, which was even better than I remembered it being last time.  We also tried the miso almond cake and edamame ice cream, which was great in that it was unique and creative the taste, quite honestly, was salty, but it all paled in comparison with the flourless chocolate cake crowned in green tea ice cream that is the bento.  Never be tempted to order a different dessert here at Nobu.  Ever.Same goes with the black cod.  Yes, its small and yes, its expensive if you order it a la carte, but its worth every luscious bite.  It should be a mustorder if you come here it comes with the omakase, but its so good, you should probably just order another.One item not part of the omakase menu is the uni tempura set.  Perhaps the deep frying hides any flaws in the uni, but I could taste that warm sweet flavor that I know is associated with high quality freshness.  Gotta love the juicy mushroom and refreshing shiso that comes with it too.  The set is also accompanied with a set of delightful salts, all used to enhance in my opinion, what needs no enhancement.

Here is my take on this restaurant after last nights visit.. cool atmosphere but thats where it ends. Our waitress was amazing. The food ... well it sucked and WAY over priced for what it was. Anyone who knows me knows Im all about good food and fun. The food was basic and bland chain type food but at almost 20avg a plate for entrees  and 12 and up appetizers was ridiculous. While thats not expensive for a night out it was for the quality and taste. When I asked the waitress for her suggestion she told me what not to order instead of what to order lol. Honestly she mentioned half the menu! For the same price go to Lago or Coastal Taco or just about anywhere else in that area and have a much better meal and go to Margaritaville for the roof top bar for drinks which is why Im at least giving the chain 2 stars.. the staff all were extremely friendly too!',0,0,0,2.31858407079646,0.5663716814159292,0.1150442477876106,0.1592920353982301,0.2388480392156863,0.5215686274509804,6,4,0.4053469711234847,6,'topping ingredient, vegetarian, italian','Restaurants, American (Traditional), Nightlife, Bars',0,'Cleveland',41.5006246,-81.7064669,'Margaritaville- Cleveland'),(195,'TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg','OScDOYzsLaeo5iU0BjSA','nby1tJexT0QXMFzTSkJoA',4,'2012-01-23','Great service, great food and great atmosphere.

You are rushed to order and if you have any problems or questions you are met with eye rolls and sighs. Im not a picky eater, not at all, but service is key. Now to the food. I remember the food they used to have was great. Unfortunately that didnt seem to translate over time. Like watching the slow death of a once great king, the food quality has seemed to die too.  Over salty broth, oily broth, boiled gyoza, and an appalling meat to rice ratio on their side dishes. What happened? WHAT HAPPENED? To this Im sorry Monta... You have lost me.

In fact, she enjoyed it so much that she purchased a gift card, which came with a 5 coupon, so she could order more pie to take home.The hot cocoa was rich, not too sweet, and complemented the pie nicely.The Rest of the StoryThis franchise is well known for doing a high volume pie business and they excel primarily in the area of variety. In order to offer their product at a reasonable price, their pies are apparently mass produced off site. Although the quality of the pie was good, I cannot confidently say that it is well above what can be found at other similar franchises, especially when it comes to the crust. Neither of the two pieces of pie we were served looked much like what was depicted in the menu, which is usual and quite understandable. Never the less, I was still expecting a larger portion from a restaurant that specializes in pie, especially on a major holiday.EpilogueThe service was prompt and courteous and the prices were reasonable.My girlfriend was happy with the way we concluded our evening and that was good enough to make me happy and satisfied.Photo design by Billie Z.',1,0,0,3,0.5405405405405406,0.2162162162162162,0.081081081081081,0.2667117117117117,0.6166216216216217,26,2,0.5694984416054361,9,'topping ingredient, vegetarian, southern ,us','Restaurants, American (Traditional), Breakfast & Brunch',0,'Chandler',33.2634515,-111.858023,'Village Inn'),(207,'V4Lu6jbMdlimpVFGPAFkdQ','tcggl2bVrQSWycuYkCIIA','oNQIZQnalRlLyZxKkJ08A',5,'2017-04-12','Youve probably heard people gush about this place.

The gentleman to my left suggested the Veal Fire Roasted Veal Chop wHorseradish  Maple Glaze  Wild Rice Tamale  Sage Butter. Being that he was a meat distributer, we took him on his word. We also ordered the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin w Bourbon  Ancho Chile Sauce  Sweet Potato Tamale  Crushed Pecan Butter and for an appetizer, the Blue Corn Pancake w Barbecued Duck  Habanero ChileStar Anise Sauce. The Blue Corn Pancake w BBQd Duck came out first. It was yummy and quite different from what Im used to. Id definitely would recommend it for anyone that wants to try BBQ Duck thats not typical Peking Duck.Our entrees came out next. The veal chop was probably a bit hyped up. The best way to describe it was that we were underwhelmed by the veal. Ive had really tender roast veal at Pines of Rome Pines of Rome on Yelp where I didnt need to cut it with a knife it just fell of the bone. The veal at Mesa Grill was a bit tough to cut up and eat and we could barely taste the maple in the horseradishmaple glaze. The wild rice tamale w sage butter was definitely tastier than the veal. Kind of disappointing being that the veal dish was 42 and we only enjoyed the tamale! The pork tenderloin was much better but not quite living up to the reviews weve read on Yelp reviews. The spices seemed to overwhelm the pork and I struggled with rubbing off some of the ancho chile sauce which was liberally drizzled all over the pork tenderloin it was also all over the blue corn pancake w duck. The saving grace of the meal was the delicious sweet potato tamale w pecan butter. That definitely helped balance the heavily spiced pork and it was all around yummy goodness! All in all, I definitely would give Mesa Grill another shot but wouldnt feel compelled to order the veal or the pork tenderloin again....

Gates  Brovi has a very casual, cute interior with booth seating near the windows and large tables. It also had a sports bar feel to it as well, with a full bar and bar stools. It is surprisingly quite large outside and seems like a pretty familyfriendly restaurant. Despite its location, there is a map outside the front door stating places where customers can park for free nearby which is very helpful.The food at Gates  Brovi is good, but nothing extremely unique. I do have to say that the presentation of the food is really welldone though  it is all set up tastefully and makes the dish look a lot fancier and more Instagrammable! There are multiple fried seafood offerings that arent found in a lot of other restaurants, but there is nothing in the flavor or texture that really impressed me. A few of the items we tried Clam Pie 35. I was really intrigued by this dish initially but it wasnt what I expected. The clams are very tiny and incorporated as a topping on a pizza. However, the pizza itself is pretty greasy and the seafood flavor is very muted. I ended up adding a lot of seasoning myself and felt that it wasnt something I really ever needed to order again. Crispy Shrimp Cakes 35. Again, a really beautiful dish. It comes with about 6 shrimp cakes which good to share, and some remoulade sauce. The battering was really thick though and deeply fried, which masked the actual shrimp flavor as well. I think the shrimp cakes also taste better without the remoulade sauce  I normally am a huge fan of remoulade, but their recipe is very strong and overpowers the natural flavors of shrimp. I think this dish could be a hit with a few minor modifications though. Cheese Curds 35. Super beautiful cheese curds  they are really crisp looking and has some sort of green onion or seasoning in it. Unfortunately, they also did not taste as good as they looked. I wish the cheese curds were more melty on the inside, and a little greasier on the outside. In addition, the ranch sauce was pretty weird for me in flavor  something just tasted a little off.I think that Gates  Brovi has a great foundation, but it could be improved upon easily with improved dipping sauces and a few taste tests. The service was fantastic and while I wasnt horribly blown away by this place, it is a nice place to stop in for some decent food if you are in the area.',2,2,3,3.710691823899371,1.220125786163522,0.5974842767295597,0.5534591194968553,0.1969484126984127,0.5612857142857144,26,7,0.5398842644130553,8,'topping ingredient, vegetarian, southern ,us','Nightlife, Sandwiches, Bars, American (New), Sports Bars, Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch',0,'Madison',43.052916,-89.435789,'Gates & Brovi'),(231,'YmIYjZGnuZzqVPkFBF4Omw','3P2YNGuZhG4y1TrjvOFDMA','10bSswW2cV2grcthQQ',2,'2016-08-03','Doesnt really deliver on promise.

I had such high expectations for Burgatory and the new location that just opened in Mccandless crossing meant you cant go wrong correct? Dead wrong. Ill review my most recent experience. We arrived about 445 on Friday night, before the dinner crowd arrived and were seated. I was feeling some nachos so we ordered the six napkin nachos. They came with chili, cheese, jalapeos, corn and a bunch of sour cream. These things were downright disgusting. The cheese had no taste, the chips were stale, and the jalapeos didnt taste anything like jalapeos. They put a ton of corn on them with very little chili. I told the waitress I didnt like them. She took them off the table. My sister ordered the mortys steakhouse burger and said it was good. I got the Buffaloed Bison. The waitress recommended that be cooked with a little pink I usually get well done burgers. The fries had a Cajun taste to it, but all I could taste was fryer grease. The burger was just ok. Wasnt crazy about it. I went home and felt slouchy and then sat in front of my toilet waiting to throw up for an hour. I had just a bad taste and feeling inside me which was perhaps from the pink in my burger. My bill came to 22 for just the burger and a vanilla milkshake. Luckily the waitress removed the nachos from the bill, but this girl had an attitude pretty much from the moment we sat down. Final conclusion of this place is that I am not impressed and will not be returning to any burgatory location. I think they hired prissy girls off the street who have nothing but sour puss faces and horrible attitudes. The milkshakes are way too strong and they put way too many pretzels, marshmallows, etc. in the shakes and the burger selection is very poor. If you are looking for a good burger place go to Burger 21 on mcknight road where Qdoba used to be or go to BRGR or Red Robin in cranberry. Those places are much better. Better food, better selections, better milkshakes, better dining, and better customer service. Very disappointed in Burgatory!!

The overall experience however was a memorable one because it was expensive and underwhelming.

Also they gave us complementary chicken wings. YAY for us! Next we ordered the short rib yellow curry, Arawan pad Thai and crispy pork with veggies. Short Rib Yellow Curry this dish was amazing.!! The short rib was soo tender and juicy. It fell right off the bone and the yellow curry paired perfectly for an amazing dish. I compare it to Lotus of Siams duck curry. Arawan Pad Thai this dish came with two huge prawns on top the mound of pad thai noodles. You can also choose the spiciness of this dish and we opt for mild. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the prawns were juicy. Crispy Pork with veggies Im not sure if this is the correct name of the dish but I always order this dish at all Thai restaurants. Its such a simple dish but whats different for me is the sauce they use. There sauce was great! The crispy pork wasnt over done and too crispy, it was just right.

My hubby and I were in Scottsdale from CA for a weekend getaway and were on a plant based diet right now not usually vegetarian  vegan, and the good reviews for the Loving Hut drew us in for Valentines Day dinner. Food was actually delicious. Like I said, we are not even vegan but it was good. I had the Spicy Cha Cha super breaded, which I didnt realize, but it was good. Hubby had the Clay Pot, and we also started with the wontons. Service is why I cant give this place more than two stars. It took FOREVER to get our food. Im not exaggerating when I say it took more than an hour from when we ordered to when hubbys food came out. And another 15 min for mine! He was done before mine came out. And yeah, it was crowded, but not the typical crazy you see at other places on Valentines Day. Im not giving it one star because at least one waitress  not ours mind you, a different one  noticed me sitting there with no food as hubby finished, so she inquired with us. When we told her mine never came out, she checked on it, eventually bringing it out and also taking it off the bill. Anyway, that was our experience. Good food, very very very slow, subpar service, with the exception of one nice waitress who went out of her way to check on us. We wouldnt return, even if we did live in the area.',2,2,0,3.933333333333333,1.1777777777777778,0.6666666666666666,0.6888888888888889,0.2854602415128731,0.6103884711779448,10,3,0.4210208760537708,6,'topping ingredient, vegetarian, italian','Vietnamese, Vegetarian, Restaurants, Chinese, Sandwiches, Vegan',0,'Phoenix',33.494905,-112.0113546,'Loving Hut'),(277,'e178giuAicIhb16ymOtiBg','bh17u9rsjl7a4lqI8hTWg','jLQLnQLjBZLrToaYqLUA',4,'2015-06-14','I came here with my parents for lunch.

No problems here.I ordered the chicken and waffles because thats their specialty and it should fill me up from about 11am til dinnertime.It arrived quickly in all its visual majesty. It really is an impressive tower. Check out my pic, its like 250 in the yelp list. Four large waffles topped by a 4 giant pieces of fried chicken. This is going to be awesome I said to myself.Then, I started eating some of it, and my joy turned to sorrow. Sadly, the fried chicken had no flavor. I dont think Ive ever had flavorless fried chicken, but this place somehow pulled it off.Next, the waffles. There too was a I disappointed. They were really bready and had none of that malty waffle goodness. I had to ask for more syrup just to make the whole thing edible.Yes, it is a gigantic amount of food, but for 16, it better look AND taste good, and this wasnt the case.

My husband and I have been trying to eat at the one in San Diego for a really long time but the wait is always so long. We were in Vegas this weekend with Family and wanted to finally try it.  It was located inside Imperial Palace on a 2nd floor of the hotel. Imperial Palace is not the nicest hotel but when you finally make it to the restaurant the decor is nice and the restaurant is pretty big. My husband ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles and we both shared it. We specifically wanted to try it because we saw it on Man vs. Food and saw Adam try the dish. The dish is definitely way too big for one person so sharing is a MUST when you go to Hash house.  It was very tasty and the chicken is not oily so it was a plus for me!  The presentation of the dish was definitely cool.  The waiter said the wait for the food after we ordered was 45 minutes since it was made from scratch but  it came out after only waiting for 10 minutes. 3 stars for the service for me.

To start out, my wife is really fussy.  To the point where I get embarrassed with the particulars of her requests.  She wants food that has no MSG, it cannot taste oily she likes brown rice not white rice and the food cant be too sweet.  Food must taste like food, not candy.  Most other places layer on the sugar, MSG and oil.Every time we walked by this place it smells really good, so I finally convinced her to try it.  She went into her usual complicated requests, but the guy was very patient with her, took time to explain its only a teaspoon of soybean oil he uses, and that his combination helps with the taste.  To exclude it totally, it would not be what she would like.  It went a few rounds, but she agreed and we got our order.  I was simpler.  Kung Pao and white rice.  I was told I could get fried rice, I appreciated that, but opted for simple white rice.The chefowner was very concerned and asked what we thought after our take out was delivered to us.  Well, we had got it to go, so could not reassure him as yet.  But I appreciate that he cared enough to come check if we were happy.Got home, ate that stuff up.  Wife was very happy.  You dont know what a compliment this is.  She is so fussy.  Mine was very good too.  We both agreed we will go back and try some more.  If they keep up the flavorful, not oily, not too sweet and good size Pei Wei gives you 23 rice and 13 food.  This was full food and a side of rice., it could be a regular place for us.I understand that Orange Chicken is suppose to be sweet, so when I try that, I will not ding them.  Its just that not all things are to be too sweet, and they seem to have that down.

Well ok at least she acknowledged us! It only got worse from there.. The guy putting the condiments on the sandwiches was one of the slowest workers I have ever witnessed. He just couldnt get it together and took a few minutes to put on a few condiments on each sandwich. The lady in front of me turned around and gave me a what the hell, this is taking so long face.

TOO MUCH PEPPER in the sausage. YUMMY biscuit, and all the meals came with a choice of a beer or mimosa. I chose the mimosa... PERFECT! My pregnant wife however was not able to enjoy one of the tasty mimosas. Instead, she decided to get a soda. Much to our surprise, our bill came with 2 brunch combos which included 2 drinks, and a charge for her soda... Long story short, the manager told us that they want to encourage drinking with brunch and that there are zero substitutes... They wouldnt budge for my pregnant wife or my 14 y.o. cousin. They said to give it to someone else at the table. We asked to have the additional beverages compd 2 sodas 4.50...20 cents each cost. We were told no again, and given our checks back.Poor logic, management, and customer service. I get it, its a brewery what do you expect. I would expect some type of accommodation or option given the family based neighborhood they are located in, and trying to attract the Brunch crowd. Their wait staff was great and did everything they could to find alternatives to the drink situation...

When we arrived to the restaurant we were seated at a nice table in the beautiful courtyard and once we ordered our drinks the five course meal began.  Wonderfully prepared, the meal was amazing and a perfect mix of flavors! The onion gratinee tastes as good as it looked on the food network.  Warm, cheesy, and full of flavor. The duck confit with roasted corn and foie gras appetizer was amazing.  For dinner we had the diver scallops and flat iron steak, fabulous!!! Definitely the meals of choice.

We believe in moderation in all things. A little self control is required!  I promise, you will eat again so keep the splurging to a meal or two a week. Luckily in Vegas there are lots of healthy places to stop and eat and not feel guilty. I mean I can think of 4 or 5 just on Eastern!  Greens and Proteins can fill your stomach with some high quality fuel and make your taste buds jump for joy all while making sure you look good for the pool party season. The salads are awesome and you can add really good salmon for a protein boost. The lettuce wraps are always a light healthy meal. Their juices are good but for me I ask them to leave some of the fruit out as I dont want as much sugar.  The staff is helpful and efficient.  You can get in and out quickly for breakfast, lunch or dinner or you can also choose to sit and enjoy a great meal and conversation. I love sitting outside and feeling the wonderful Vegas warmth in the evenings. Enjoy a glass of the complimentary cucumber water that is ice cold and plentiful. We all love to eat but we all also want to be healthy and look great. We all like convenience and most of us dont have time or desires to cook three meals a day.  This place can help you live the life you want while eating healthy and enjoying your food. Eat to live, but live to experience life.

I had a couple of girlfriends in from out of town and they claimed the sushi was very fresh. Most of the specialty rolls are delicious. My favorites are the the riceless rolls, though the rules of AYCE only allows each person to order 1 of each. I only gave four stars because of the numerous rules the restaurant has on the AYCE and how strict they are. I believe between the four of us, we had ordered 12 rolls, miso soups, gyoza, rib eye, a bowl of ramen, and fried rice. We stuffed ourselves to a miserable capacity and had to leave 2 pieces of sushi. We were charged for the entire cost of the roll in addition to the four AYCE.

The reason why  I chose this boutique hotel, was because my husband and I were traveling to Vegas with our two dogs.  Even though most of the big hotels in LV accept dogs now, it is extremely difficult to have to walk far distances to get to the elevators, across the million of people, and the casino just to take you dogs to go potty! Good luck with that! the ARTISAN Hotel was just PERFECT!! it is only 45 floors high, so you can take the elevator or just simply the side stairs in be at the lobby level within a minute! There is a great area on the back, just after you pass the pool with gravel and yard, very private and you can take your dogs there for their potty time!  The staff was soooo nice, helpful and extremely accommodating!!! they are very dog friendly as the guests staying there as well, so you will feel very comfortable!! The rates are also very affordable. Some hotels will charge you an arm and a leg for a pet fee . Being a dog owner, I know the difficulties we go thru with our pooches all the time we travel and the staff at Artisan made our stay very relaxing! Drake at the front desk was extremely nice too! Dont let the minor stars reviews guide you.  There is nothing sketchy about the location either.  The hotel is located right off the Sahara exit, which is conveniently located within 5 minutes to the strip! We used to live in Las Vegas, so we are very familiar to all the exits and short cuts, so for us the location was very convenient and away from the busy strip!

Ive been eyeing this place for a bit, so I was excited to finally give this is a shot. This review is for brunch.The ambiance was excellent, especially at the time, there were fresh flowers everywhere. The service was friendly and prompt. Everything looked good on the menu. This seems to be a wellloved establishment, so why three stars? If youre reading this, better find a chair and sit down...Lets start with the Korean Fried chicken and Waffles. I loved the flavor, but the fried chicken was dry and rubbery, like a governmentissued chicken fingers school lunch. At this level, Id except juiciness and meltinyourmouth tenderness, but it wasnt the case. The waffle was also overcooked and crumbly like a cookie, instead of soft and pillowy. Youre better off with ChickFilA strips and waffle fries instead of this dish. I did love the creative twist on the popovers presented as pancakes, that one was good. Maybe I shouldve ordered the pork belly, that one is hard to mess up.Due to the sheer reputation of the place, Ill give this another shot and update my review. Maybe it was an offday. Maybe they do dinner better. Maybe this is better as a bar. I dont yet know. Allinall, for now, 3 stars.',8,2,2,4.2,1.053658536585366,0.2829268292682926,0.5219512195121951,0.2464409722222222,0.6548611111111112,24,6,0.5603546308944147,8,'topping ingredient, vegetarian, mexican','American (New), Nightlife, Restaurants, Bars',0,'Cleveland',41.4852089,-81.7264904,'Spice Kitchen + Bar'),(378,'sXYkjcuGhtaYP8yeQPaHgA','zFPdtvaUQeyABU7uFLcCVw','Y3d9qSHqQgFH8kyVnD3mA',2,'2016-12-02','Very popular place, but I am just not a fan.

I called for reservations a few weeks ago, and the restaurants voicemail instructed me to call back during business hours or leave a voicemail. I called back a few times during business hours, but still did not connect with an actual person, so I left a voicemail requesting a reservation. I did not receive a call back. I showed up in person several hours later and asked what the wait would be for my party. The host, upon hearing my name, said she had received my voicemail but forgot to call me back. She said there was no way they could seat me until almost 10 PM  four hours later! That was unacceptable to me and my group and I went elsewhere.I totally understand that mistakes happen, and I would have been okay if there had been some attempt to squeeze us in or accommodate us in some way. But the attitude was sorry and that was basically it. I would have been fine waiting 10 or so minutes while they tried to figure out if some type of dinner arrangements could be made  but it was pretty much, youre out of luck.
